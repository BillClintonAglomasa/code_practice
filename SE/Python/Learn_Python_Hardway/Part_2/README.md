3. ex30.py
This file implements using the 'if', 'elif' and 'else' statements.

4. ex30_1.py

5. ex31.py
This file implements a simple game using the 'if, elif and else' statements.

6. ex32.py

7. ex33.py
This file implements how to use 'while' loop.

8. ex33_1.py

9. ex33_2.py
This file implements a while loop in a function that takes two arguments.

10. ex33_3.py
This file implements a for loop in a function that takes 3 arguments.

11. ex34.py
This file implements how to take items from a list using both cardinal and ordinal number system.

12. ex34_1.py
This file implements ex34.py by removing redundant codes.

13. ex38.py
This file implements a script to split a sentence into a list and append words from a list to it

14. ex38_1.py
This file implements ex38 put uses for loop instead of a while loop

15. ex39.py
This file implements how to create and derive items from dictionaries using a for loop

16. ex39_1.py
This file implements a simple dictionary for the regions of Ghana

17. ex40.py
This file implements a class in python.

18. ex40_1.py
This file implements a class in python and creating 3 instances of the class.

19. ex41.py
This file implements looping over dictionary and lists to teach concepts in how classes are created and inherited

20. ex41_1.py
This file implements ex41.py but with comments added

21. ex42.py
This file implements the characteristics of class: instantiation, inheritance, composition and attribute.

22. ex42_1.py
This file comments the code in ex42.py to solidify the concenpts in the exercise.

23. ex42_2.py
This file adds methods and functions to the classes created in ex42.py.

24. ex43_classes.py
This file contains classes to implement a game.

25. ex44a.py
This file implements inheritance where a child process executes a function in it's parent class.

26. ex44b.py
This file implements inheritance where a child class overrides a function call in a parent class because it has it's own implementation.

27. ex44c.py
This file implements inheritance by explicitly calling the super keyword in a child class to call a function in the parent class.

28. ex44d.py
This file implements three forms in which inheritance can be applied. 
1. Through a creation of a function/method in a parent class that in implicitly called when an object of the child class calls the function.
2. Through the creation of the same function/method in a child class that is implemented differently in the child class.
3. Thirdly, through explicitly calling the super function to call a particular function/method from the parent class.

29. ex44e.py
This file implements the use of object oriented programming by creating to classes that instead of inheriting classes, rather inherits methods from a different class and thereby eliminating issues that come with multiple inheritance.
