This directory contains small programs in C which is needed to build competency
in the C program. The a.out file is always updated to run the debug the programs
that are written.

Description of programs.
1.0 ex1_print_hello.c
This program prints hello to output.

2.0 ex2.0_convert_fahrenheit_celcius.c
This program implements conversion of fahrenheit to celcius

3.0 ex2.1_convert_fahrenheit_celcius.c
This program implements conversion of fahrenheit to celcius using a while loop
and printf for formatting output.

4.0 ex2.2_convert_fahrenheit_celcius.c
This program implements the conversion of fahrenheit to celsius and outputs it
in a table format.

5.0 ex2.3_convert_fahrenheit_celcius.c
This program implements the conversion of temperature in fahrenheit to celcius
using a for loop.

6.0 ex2.4_symbolic_constants.c
This program implements the conversion of temperature in fahrenheit to celcius
using a for loop and symbolic constants.

7.0 ex3.0_copy_character.c
This program copies from input and prints it.

8.0 ex3.1_copy_character.c
This program copies from input and prints it. Less verbose as compared to
ex3.0_copy_character.

9.0 ex3.2_print_EOF.c
This program prints the value of EOF.

10.0 ex3.3_print_value_EOF.c
This program prints the possible values of the expression 'getchar() != EOF'.

11.0 ex4.0_character_count.c
This program uses a while loop to count the number of characters.

12.0 ex4.1_character_count.c
This program uses a for loop to count the number of characters.

13.0 ex5.0_count_lines.c
This program count the number of lines.

14.0 ex5.1_count_lines_tabs_blanks.c
This program count the number of lines, tabs and blanks in an input.

15.0 ex5.2_replace_blank.c
This program replaces two or more consecutive blanks in an input with just
a blank when it outputs it.

16.0 ex5.3_replace_newline_tabs_blanks.c
This program replaces newline, tabs and blanks from input with '\n', '\t'
and '\b' respectively in ouput.

17.0 ex6.0_count_characters_lines_words.c
This program counts characters, lines and words from input.

18.0 ex6.1_prints_input_per_line.c
This program prints words from output on a newline.

19.0 ex7.0_count_digits_white_spaces_others.c
This program counts digits, white spaces and other characters from input.

20.0 ex8.0_power_function.c
This program contains a function that take two parameters, exponent and base,
to compute calculations.

21.0 ex8.1_power_function.c
A function that computes result of a power calculation. This function uses C's
principle, where arguments values are copied and a function does not change the
real value.

22.0 ex8.2_temperature_conversion.c
This program uses fahrtocel function to convert temperature from fahrenheit to
celsius and iterate 10x by reducing the value of the fahrenhiet temperature that
is converted.

23.0 ex9.0_reads_lines_print_longest.c
This program uses get_line and copy functions to count the total number of
characters of a line and if a new line is longer than the previous line, it
copies it and then prints it to the screen.

24.0 ex9.1_reads_lines_print_longest.c
This program is similar to ex9.0_reads_lines_print_longest.c but this also
prints to output the character length of the longest line.

25.0 ex9.2_reads_lines_print_longest.c
This program is similar to ex9.1_reads_lines_print_longest.c but instead print
any line with characters beyond 79.

26.0 ex9.3_reads_lines_print_longest.c
This program is similar to ex9.1_reads_lines_print_longest.c but removes
terminating tabs and newlines and also does not print empty lines.

27.0 ex10_external_variables_scope.c
This program uses get_line and copy functions to count the total number of
characters of a line and if a new line is longer than the previous line, it
copies it and then prints it to the screen. Instead of using local variables,
this uses extern function to declare global variables to implement the program.
